During my PhD studies in Information and Communication Technologies at the <a href="https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/INFORMATION-AND-COMMUNICATION-TECHNOLOGY-(ICT)_nD3552_EN.aspx">University of Roma Sapienza</a> I continued working at my automatic weather-snow (AWSS) station project which I started in the far 2016 and which is described <a href="https://edrap.github.io//maws">here</a>. 

The AWSS is powered with solar panels and an accumulation battery which guarantee several days of functioning without solar energy. It consists in several atmospheric and snow sensors which are connected to a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>, which hosts a client that reads the data measured at a custom interval and sends them to a private server through GSM connection. In case there is a network failure form the client or server side and the data are not present in the server database, the client send back to the server all the missing past data to the served as soon as the internet connection is restored and the remote server become again available.

There are actually two versions of the AWSS working with slightly different setups: in one case atmospheric and snow measurements are directly read by the Raspberry Pi from the custom made sensors through the client, in the second case instead the atmospheric data are measured with <a href="http://www.davisnet.com/solution/vantage-pro2/">Davis Vantage Pro 2</a> senors, and read from the station console. 

The AWSS with the first setup is installed at <a href="https://www.campofelice.it/">Campo Felice ski resort</a>, at 1790 m a.s.l. and the AWSS with the second setup is installed at Pietrattina, at 1459 m a.s.l., and is equipped also with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/">Raspberry Camera Module V1</a> in order to take pictures of the weather conditions. 

The AWSS have been financed by the CETEMPS research center and the no-profit association <a href="https://www.meteoaquilano.it">Meteoaquilano</a>. 

The data measured by the two weather stations can be seen on Meteoaquilano <a href="https://www.meteoaquilano.it">realtime data page</a>.
