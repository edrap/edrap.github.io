My interest for mountains, snow and weather made me think on how to record weather data in a not man-made environment with a low budget. I decided to put an automatic weather station on <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruppo_montuoso_di_Monte_Calvo">Monte Calvo</a>, a mountain close to L'Aquila.
I chosed this site because of the interesting metereological positioning of the site and for my love for that mountain.
The power supply was a crucial point for this installation. Solar power was the easyest solution, but to reduce the costs
a low power consumption system had to be used. So I focused on the raspberry py, since it's really easy to program and flexible.
The second crucial point was what kind of weather station whould have fit the goal. At this point I decided to talk with <a href="http://www.meteoaquilano.it/">MeteoAQuilano</a>, an association of well prepared people that monitors the climate of L'Aquila and the surroundings with a huge number of weather stations and makes daily weather forecasts for these territories.
They suggested to use a <a href="http://www.davisnet.com/solution/vantage-pro2/">Davis Vantage Pro 2</a>. It's a quite professional weather station not too expensive.
