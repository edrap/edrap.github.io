My interest in mountains, snow and weather made me think on how to record weather data in a not man-made environment having a limited budget. I decided to put an automatic weather station on <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruppo_montuoso_di_Monte_Calvo">Monte Calvo</a>, a mountain close to L'Aquila. I chosed this installation site because of the interesting metereological position and my love for that mountain.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For this installation I worked with <a href="http://www.meteoaquilano.it/">MeteoAQuilano</a>, a team of well prepared people that monitors the climate of L'Aquila and the surroundings with a huge number of weather stations and makes daily weather forecasts for these territories. We opted for a <a href="http://www.davisnet.com/solution/vantage-pro2/">Davis Vantage Pro 2</a>, a quite professional weather station but not too expensive.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Data are readed from the station console by a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 2B</a> through <a href="http://www.weewx.com/">Weewx</a>, an open source software that also put them online by a <a href="http://www.3g-modem-wiki.com/page/Huawei+E169+(E169G,+E169V,+K3520)">Huawei e169</a>. Pictures of the weather conditions are taken by the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/">Raspberry Camera Module V1</a> that mounts a wide-angle 160 degrees lens. All the electronics are located in a weatherproof box, and the system is powered by a solar panel, a battery and a charge controller. The station even present a snow depth ultrasonic sensor. For that I used the <a href="http://www.electroschematics.com/8902/hc-sr04-datasheet/">HC-SR04</a> sensor connected to the raspberry GPIO.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The realtime data can be seen on <a href="http://www.meteoaquilano.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=261">MeteoAQuilano</a>, <a href="http://my.meteonetwork.it/station/abr081/">Meteonetwork</a>, <a href="http://www.lineameteo.it/stazioni.php?id=1518">LineaMeteo</a> and <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=ISCOPPIT3">Wunderground</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
All the relevant codes are on my <a href="https://github.com/edrap/">GitHub page</a>. I'm not a programmer and my coding knowledge is limited. I'm sure that there are several smarter ways to write my codes and I'll be happy to receive your hints to improve them.

<!-- The power supply was a crucial point for this installation. Solar power was the easyest solution, but to reduce the costs
a low power consumption system had to be used. So I focused on the raspberry py, since it's really easy to program and flexible.
The second crucial point was what kind of weather station whould have fit the goal. At this point I decided to talk with <a href="http://www.meteoaquilano.it/">MeteoAQuilano</a>, an association of well prepared people that monitors the climate of L'Aquila and the surroundings with a huge number of weather stations and makes daily weather forecasts for these territories. At this point started my collaboration with them, and now I'm an association member. 
They suggested to use a <a href="http://www.davisnet.com/solution/vantage-pro2/">Davis Vantage Pro 2</a>. It's a quite professional weather station but not too expensive. -->
