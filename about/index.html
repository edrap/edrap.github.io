I'm a Postdoctoral researcher at <a href="http://cetemps.aquila.infn.it/" target="_blank">CETEMPS</a>, in the  
<a href="https://www.univaq.it" target="_blank">University of L'Aquila</a>.
I'm interested in weather and snow cover modelling, and snowpack stability for avalanche forecasting.
  
I was born in L'Aquila, a small city in central Italy. I studied Physics at the 
<a href="http://www.dsfc.univaq.it/en/" target="_blank">Department of Physical and Chemical Sciences</a> of
the <a href="http://www.univaq.it/en/" target="_blank">University of L'Aquila</a> and 
Atmospheric and Cryosferic Sciences at the <a href="http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/"target="_blank">ACINN</a> of the
<a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/" target="_blank">University of Innsbruck</a> conducting my Master Thesis at the 
<a href="http://www.slf.ch/index_EN" target="_blank">WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF)</a> of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos" target="_blank">Davos</a>, and I got a PhD at the department of <a href="http://phdict.uniroma1.it/" target="_blank">Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uniroma1.it" target="_blank">University of Roma Sapienza</a>. I've been loving mountains since I was a child, especially the Apennines. Snow landscapes always fascinated me and aroused the interest to 
understand the processes that regulate snowfall, snow settlement and avalanches triggering. In central Italy extreme snowfall 
are becoming much more frequent during the recent years due to the climate change, and much more people are approaching 
skitouring and freeride. Nevertheless snow microphysics and avalanches forecasting studies are completely neglected in 
this region. I hope to bring attention to these topics and contribute with my research.
  
I'm currently collaborating with <a href="http://www.meteoaquilano.it/" target="_blank">MeteoAQuilano</a>, a team that monitors the climate 
of L'Aquila and the surroundings with a huge number of weather stations and makes daily weather forecasts for these 
territories with professionalism and passion.

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">
I am PhD student at the <a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/">Geophysical Institute</a> of the
<a href="http://www.uaf.edu/">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>.
My research is based at the <a href="http://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/">Glaciers Group</a> and focuses on firn hydrology in Greenland.
The project investigates the spatio-temporal variations of refreezing in the firn of the Kangerlussuaq section of the Greenland
ice sheet and its role in the surface mass budget combining in-situ observations, remote sensing data and regional climate modeling.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I was born in Rovereto, a small town south of the Central Eastern Alps main ridge.
Since my earliest childhood I was fascinated by winter landscapes, mountains and wilderness.
During my studies in Physics and Atmospheric Sciences I developed a keen interest in understanding the processes governing the atmosphere, glaciers and climate.
For more than two years I was a core member of the Ice and Climate field work team at the Institute of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences of Innsbruck
(<a href="http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/">ACINN</a>). I was involved in planning, organizing and executing the glacier mass balance monitoring program of glaciers
in the Ötztal Alps (Austria) and in the Ortler Group (Italy).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am proud to actively contribute to the understanding of climate changes with my work and research.
For further details please check out my CV.</p>
