I am a Master student at the <a href="http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/">Institute of Atmospheric and Cryosferic Sciences (ACINN)</a> of the
<a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/">University of Innsbruck</a>. I'm interested in weather, climate and especially snow settlement and
avalanche forecasting. For that reason I'm doint a joint Master's thesis between the <a href="http://www.slf.ch/index_EN">WSL-Institut für Schnee und Lawinenforschung
(SLF)</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos">Davos</a> and the <a href="http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/">ACINN</a>.
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I was born in L'Aquila, a small city in central Italy. I studied Physics at the <a href="http://www.dsfc.univaq.it/en/">Department 
of Physical and Chemical Sciences</a> at the <a href="http://www.univaq.it/en/">University of L'Aquila</a>. I've been loving
mountains since I was a child, especially the Apennines. Snow landscapes always fascinated me and aroused the interest to understand
the processes that regulate snowfall, snow settlement and avalanches triggering. In central Italy extreme snowfall are becoming much more frequent during the
recent years due to the climate change, and much more people are approaching skitouring and freeride. Nevertheless 
snow microphysics and avalanches forecasting studies are completely neglected in this region. I hope to bring attention to these
topics and contribute with my knowledge.
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm currently working with <a href="http://www.meteoaquilano.it/">MeteoAQuilano</a>, a team that monitors the climate of L'Aquila
and the surroundings with a huge number of weather stations and makes daily weather forecasts for these territories with professionalism
and passion.

I am PhD student at the <a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/">Geophysical Institute</a> of the
<a href="http://www.uaf.edu/">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>.
My research is based at the <a href="http://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/">Glaciers Group</a> and focuses on firn hydrology in Greenland.
The project investigates the spatio-temporal variations of refreezing in the firn of the Kangerlussuaq section of the Greenland
ice sheet and its role in the surface mass budget combining in-situ observations, remote sensing data and regional climate modeling.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I was born in Rovereto, a small town south of the Central Eastern Alps main ridge.
Since my earliest childhood I was fascinated by winter landscapes, mountains and wilderness.
During my studies in Physics and Atmospheric Sciences I developed a keen interest in understanding the processes governing the atmosphere, glaciers and climate.
For more than two years I was a core member of the Ice and Climate field work team at the Institute of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences of Innsbruck
(<a href="http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/">ACINN</a>). I was involved in planning, organizing and executing the glacier mass balance monitoring program of glaciers
in the Ötztal Alps (Austria) and in the Ortler Group (Italy).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am proud to actively contribute to the understanding of climate changes with my work and research.
