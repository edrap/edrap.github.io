I am a Master student at the <a href="http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/">Institute of Atmospheric and Cryosferic Sciences (ACINN)</a> of the
<a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/">University of Innsbruck</a>


<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">
I am PhD student at the <a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/">Geophysical Institute</a> of the
<a href="http://www.uaf.edu/">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>.
My research is based at the <a href="http://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/">Glaciers Group</a> and focuses on firn hydrology in Greenland.
The project investigates the spatio-temporal variations of refreezing in the firn of the Kangerlussuaq section of the Greenland
ice sheet and its role in the surface mass budget combining in-situ observations, remote sensing data and regional climate modeling.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I was born in Rovereto, a small town south of the Central Eastern Alps main ridge.
Since my earliest childhood I was fascinated by winter landscapes, mountains and wilderness.
During my studies in Physics and Atmospheric Sciences I developed a keen interest in understanding the processes governing the atmosphere, glaciers and climate.
For more than two years I was a core member of the Ice and Climate field work team at the Institute of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences of Innsbruck
(<a href="http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/">ACINN</a>). I was involved in planning, organizing and executing the glacier mass balance monitoring program of glaciers
in the Ã–tztal Alps (Austria) and in the Ortler Group (Italy).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am proud to actively contribute to the understanding of climate changes with my work and research.
For further details please check out my CV.</p>
