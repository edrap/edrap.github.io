I'm a Postdoctoral researcher at <a href="http://cetemps.aquila.infn.it/" target="_blank">CETEMPS</a>, in the  
<a href="https://www.univaq.it" target="_blank">University of L'Aquila</a>.
I'm interested in weather and snow cover modelling, and snowpack stability for avalanche forecasting.
  
I was born in L'Aquila, a small city in central Italy. I studied Physics at the 
<a href="http://www.dsfc.univaq.it/en/" target="_blank">Department of Physical and Chemical Sciences</a> of
the <a href="http://www.univaq.it/en/" target="_blank">University of L'Aquila</a> and 
Atmospheric and Cryosferic Sciences at the <a href="http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/"target="_blank">ACINN</a> of the
<a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/" target="_blank">University of Innsbruck</a> conducting my Master Thesis at the 
<a href="http://www.slf.ch/index_EN" target="_blank">WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF)</a> of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos" target="_blank">Davos</a>, and I got a PhD at the department of <a href="http://phdict.uniroma1.it/" target="_blank">Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uniroma1.it" target="_blank">University of Roma Sapienza</a>. I've been loving mountains since I was a child, especially the Apennines. Snow landscapes always fascinated me and aroused the interest to 
understand the processes that regulate snowfall, snow settlement and avalanches triggering. In central Italy extreme snowfall 
are becoming much more frequent during the recent years due to the climate change, and much more people are approaching 
skitouring and freeride. Nevertheless snow microphysics and avalanches forecasting studies are completely neglected in 
this region. I hope to bring attention to these topics and contribute with my research.
  
I'm currently collaborating with <a href="http://www.meteoaquilano.it/" target="_blank">MeteoAQuilano</a>, a team that monitors the climate 
of L'Aquila and the surroundings with a huge number of weather stations and makes daily weather forecasts for these 
territories with professionalism and passion.
